Hereâ€™s a free, plug-and-play workflow templateâ€”built to be part of a full Building Safety Management System (BSMS) that aims to meet the Building Safety Act 2022 and support the first step toward a future-ready Digital Asset Management System.

Â·        Identify every safety risk
Â·        Assess & rate each risk
Â·        Mitigate, verify, repeat
Â·        Keep a live audit & review log
Â·        Capture Golden Thread data (structured, timestamped, secure)

How the template is organised:
Fire Safetyâ€ƒ|â€ƒStructural Safetyâ€ƒ|â€ƒResident Safety

Within each tab you can:
Â·        Log inspections, incidents, and resident complaints
Â·        Assign mitigation actions with clear deadlines
Â·        Track comms, escalations & MOR thresholds
Â·        Close risks only after independent verification
Â·        Relevant links to the official guidance & resources.

ðŸ“¦ The above overview structure of information entries will also support building operators in identifying various information gaps and work towards obtaining specialists input aligned to statutory requirements.
In addition, because the data is already formatted for facilitating the Building Safety Regulator Reporting, youâ€™ll have an instant audit trailâ€”roles, evidence, and statusâ€”for every HRB in scope while laying the groundwork for a single source of truth that helps teams spot information gaps and shift from reactive fixes to proactive planning.

Hope you enjoy that resource and as always â€“ please share your feedback and feel free to add your ideas and invaluable contributions â€“ lets make our buildings safer together.
